        <p> Real Code started as a project for a programming class.<br>
            I didn't have a topic or a project I wanted to display so I chose <br>
            to make a mock "create a website" kind of thing. In the future This will change <br>
            dramatically. I hope it will do something more now that I am done <br>
            with the orgininal project. If you have any ideas i would tell you to put these in<br>
            comments but it is not done. So you can post a comment on my not functional youtube<br>
            video in the home page and I will definately see it. Thanks.</p>
